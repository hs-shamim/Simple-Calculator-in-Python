### Project Description: **Simple Calculator in Python**

#### Overview:
This project is a **Simple Calculator** implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and then computes the result based on the selected operation.

---

#### Features:
1. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - The program starts by displaying a title, "Calculator," to indicate its purpose.
   - It prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator.

2. **Supported Operations**:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the user enters an invalid operator, the program displays an error message: `"Invalid operator!"`.

4. **Dynamic Input**:
   - The program uses `input()` to take user inputs and `float()` to handle decimal numbers.

5. **Output**:
   - The result of the calculation is displayed in a clear and readable format, e.g., `"Result: <value>"`.

---

#### How It Works:
1. The program starts by printing the title `"Calculator"`.
2. It asks the user to input:
   - The first number (`num1`).
   - The operator (`oper`).
   - The second number (`num2`).
3. Based on the operator, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
   - If the operator is `+`, it adds `num1` and `num2`.
   - If the operator is `-`, it subtracts `num2` from `num1`.
   - If the operator is `*`, it multiplies `num1` and `num2`.
   - If the operator is `/`, it divides `num1` by `num2`.
4. The result is converted to a string and displayed to the user.
5. If the operator is invalid, the program informs the user with an error message.

#### Example Usage:
```
Calculator

Enter your first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50.0
```

---

#### Future Improvements:
1. **Add More Operations**:
   - Include advanced operations like exponentiation (`**`), modulus (`%`), or square root.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensure the user enters valid numbers (e.g., handle non-numeric inputs gracefully).

3. **Loop for Multiple Calculations**:
   - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Implement a GUI using libraries like `tkinter` for a more interactive experience.

5. **Error Handling for Division by Zero**:
   - Add a check to prevent division by zero and display an appropriate error message.

---

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Built-in Python functions (`input()`, `print()`, `float()`, etc.)
- **Editor**: GNU Nano (or any text editor/IDE)

#### Why This Project?
This project is a great way to:
- Learn the basics of Python programming.
- Understand how to handle user input and perform conditional logic.
- Build a simple yet functional tool that can be expanded with more features.

---

#### How to Run:
1. Save the code in a file named `Calculator.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 Calculator.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
